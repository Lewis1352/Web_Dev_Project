Created an data encryption/decryption class
created a logging class with email functionality
created a log_example.php to test both classes


TODO: Need to implement my code into the main code and delete this folder and place everything in the correct place in the private folder:
1. Create containers for the classes. and place within /src
log_example is just used as a guide for how to log and also how to encrypt and decrypt data

2. encrypt all sensitive data that is being used in databases etc.
